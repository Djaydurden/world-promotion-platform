					<h3>Worldcoin is a digital currency that launches by giving away a piece to every person in the world. Co-founded in 2020 by former Y Combinator chief Sam Altman, Worldcoin aims to photograph the irises of everyone on earth in order to identify them so it can distribute its new digital money fairly. So far, the company has collected images of the eyes of hundreds of thousands of people in about 20 countries.
A biometric system can be used as the foundation for Proof-of-Personhood by ensuring each person can only register once. Similar to biometric identification, the system needs to compare each user's embedding to every other entry in the database.
Proof of personhood (PoP) is a means of resisting malicious attacks on peer to peer networks, particularly, attacks that utilize multiple fake identities, such as a Sybil attack.
 Hubble, a minimal, application-specific rollup. It allows a highly efficient, but also permissionless and non-custodial airdrop at the scale of one billion people.</h3>
