# Problem Statement
1. No decentralized promotional platform in Crypto, that make sure each person only claims their part once.
2. No possible way currently exist to distinguish if 100 different accounts belongs to 100 different people, or 1 person  has 1 account when claiming rewards.

# What is World Promotional Platform
Fully decentralized DApp to allow anyone to create promotional content and incentivize users for learning about the promotions. 

# How the DApp Works?
1. In few simple steps anyone can create a promotion for any social or entertainment cause.
2. Idea is to upload a questionnaire in JSON format and provide details about the ERC20 token they wish to give-away as part of the promotion.
3. Anyone can come to the DApp and learn about the promotions and take a short quiz.
4. Once all answers are correct user can claim their rewards ONLY once for a particular promotion.
5. With the help of WorldId integration, DApp can validate the proof of personhood claiming the rewards.
